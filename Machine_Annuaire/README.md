A telephone directory is a table that represents the correspondence between a name and a telephone number. The directory is searchable remotely because it is hosted on a server machine. A user wishing to know the number of a given person must use at his level an interface with an input field in which one enters the name of the person sought and a field answer in which one obtains the number of the person sought. The search can be triggered by a button. The directory table is stored in a database that can only be accessed by the Server Machine and can support multiple requests at the same time.
